coda (6.9.7-1+DISTVER) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Make sure tools/make-split-dist.sh is in the source tarball.
  * Add systemd unit files.
  * Do not give System:AnyUser default access to a new volume.
  * Remove code for multiple codasrv processes on a single host.
  * Use constant time compare on Coda tokens and clog/auth2 passwords.
  * Fixed a buffer overflow when getting the local hostname in the
    Coda backup program.
  * Update copyright years in the lgpl/gpl blurb.
  * We cannot safely traverse the same va_list twice, which could lead to
    crashes and undefined behaviour in Venus's eprint statements.
